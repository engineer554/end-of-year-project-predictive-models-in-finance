# end-of-year-project-predictive-models-in-finance
This project consisted on studying the different existing stochastic models used for predicting the market's volatility and estimating the european call price as well as the underlying asset price within financial markets, We then introduced a new approach that takes into account the Hegselmann Krause opinion dynamics which was later incorporated into the price formation process, the market's volatility paths as well as the call price. This project allowed us to inquire more about the #financial_modeling as well as the influence of  herding behaviour on the current state of markets.  This experience helped us to boost our motivation to further looking into this field of expertise and gain the needed experience.
